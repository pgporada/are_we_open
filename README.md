# Overview
I had the privilege of attending an AWS Michigan MeetUp at RBN in Ann Arbor, MI.

Using the code provided in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL4-7w6Lhck, I will begin learning Python 2.7.x. My goal for this is to create a small lambda function and learn how to do unit testing in Python. I want to retrieve multiple pieces of data from a function to provide a meaningful message when opened/closed. I want to output JSON and have another service retrieve that JSON.
